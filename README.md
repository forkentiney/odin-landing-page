# The Odin Project
## Project 1: Landing Page

This has been done as part of The Odin Project's full stack web development course. The lesson can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

The goal was to make a webpage from scratch that looks like [this](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png).

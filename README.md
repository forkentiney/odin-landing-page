# The Odin Project
## Project 1: Landing Page

This has been done as part of The Odin Project's full stack web development course. The lesson can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

The goal was to make a webpage from scratch that looks like [this](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png).

I used grid to align things to columns on the page, and flexbox to organize content within the page. Given the scope of this project, I didn't yet bother with adding rules for smaller screens (e.g., changing the number of columns to better suite a smaller screen). The image placeholder is not great, but it's just that: a placeholder. An actual image would behave more nicely in this space. Overall I'm happy with the pace at which I was able to complete this assignment and with how little I had to look up. Keep in mind that I have been practicing the course material on my [personal website](https://www.joshuaseverud.com) so I was largely familiar with the tools I needed to use to accomplish this task.
